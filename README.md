AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar DONE

WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours DONE

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future DONE

WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event DONE



TO DO 

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
